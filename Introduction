I’m Shubham Verma, a React Native developer with three years of experience in mobile app development.
Over the years, I’ve worked extensively with both iOS and Android platforms, focusing on building optimized, user-friendly interfaces.
I’ve successfully tackled challenges like improving app performance and integrating complex features, like push notifications using Firebase cloud messaging, dynamic linking,
Sync calendar events with google calendar and apple calendar, AI Integration, Help and support module- chatbot and Agnet chat using silent notification, chattings using sockets
, payment methods like apple pay and card payments etc.
My strengths include problem-solving and ensuring a seamless user experience, and I’m always looking to expand my skill set further in a challenging role like this. 
I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute and grow here.
